You can then use these colours and apply it to an SVG (e.g a logo, gradient or a wireframe) to see how these colours work in situe. For example if you were looking for some brand colours you could upload your logo and test it out using these colours and see if they are practical and help to decide if these colours actually work. (or use our default templates) Once a colour scheme is decided on perhaps this could generate you a little style sheet that you can then copy into your design files etc.",
